I want to build a complete, responsive website using Bootstrap 5. This project should fulfill all the core and bonus requirements listed below and match the academic assignment specs.

📌 Website Concept
Build a multi-section website called "Tech Path Finder" that helps:

Computer Science and Computer Engineering students find free courses available online.

Track companies hiring CS and CE students (internships, fresh grads, junior roles).

Include a simple chatbot that helps users decide the best course track for them based on their interests (e.g., Web Dev, Data Science, AI, Cybersecurity).

✅ Main Pages/Sections to Include:
Home Page – Attractive hero section with welcome text and a call to action.

Free Courses – Display cards of free courses (title, description, platform, link).

Company Tracker – Show a list/table of tech companies and job info (logo, location, roles, links).

Chatbot Assistant – Embed a basic JavaScript-based chatbot that uses a Q&A flow to suggest course categories.

Contact Us – Simple form with name, email, message, and Bootstrap validation.

About Us – Describe the mission of helping students discover learning paths.

Footer – With links and social icons.

🎯 Mandatory Bootstrap Components to Include:
Please make sure to include all of the following components in relevant sections:

 Navigation Bar – Responsive with dropdowns

 Cards – For each course

 Buttons – Variety of styles for CTA and chatbot

 Forms – For the contact section (with validation)

 Tables – For the company tracker

 Alerts – Confirmation messages (e.g., after submitting a form)

 Badges – To show skill level on courses (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate)

 Breadcrumbs – For page navigation

 Button Groups – For choosing course filters

 List Groups – For listing available tech fields

 Progress Bars – Visualizing course completion suggestion

 Spinners – While chatbot processes or page loads

 Pagination – On the course listing page

 Accordion – FAQs about career paths

 Tabs or Pills – Tabbed content to switch between Web Dev / AI / Cybersecurity

🌟 Optional Bonus (Extra Credit) - Use JavaScript-Powered Bootstrap Components:
Implement the following features with JavaScript:

 Carousel – On homepage showing featured courses or testimonials

 Modal Windows – To show chatbot interface in a pop-up

 Tooltips – On course cards or buttons (e.g., "Click to apply")

 Popovers – Show short company info

 Collapse Sections – For mobile menu or course filters

 Dropdowns – In navbar and filter sections

 Toast Notifications – When the chatbot finishes recommendations

 Offcanvas Menu – On mobile for extra navigation

🎨 Custom Color Palette (override Bootstrap colors):
Create a modern tech-themed color palette:

css
Copy
Edit
:root {
  --bs-primary: #0066ff;
  --bs-secondary: #00bcd4;
  --bs-success: #4caf50;
  --bs-danger: #f44336;
  --bs-warning: #ff9800;
}
Use these colors consistently across buttons, alerts, nav, backgrounds, badges, etc.
